# AGENTS.md

Fullsend is a platform for fully autonomous agentic development for Git-hosted organizations (GitHub, GitLab, Forgejo). It contains design documents organized by problem domain (`docs/`) and a Go CLI (`cmd/fullsend/`) that manages forge setup and org configuration. See [fullsend.sh](https://fullsend.sh) for the full documentation site.

## How to work in this repo

- Problem documents (`docs/problems/`) should present multiple options with trade-offs, not prescribe single solutions.
- Each problem document has an "Open questions" section — this is where unresolved issues live.
- When adding new problem areas, create a new file in `docs/problems/`. The documentation site auto-discovers files in this directory.
- The security threat model (threat priority: external injection > insider > drift > supply chain) should inform all other documents.
- Keep core problem documents organization-agnostic. Organization-specific details belong in `docs/problems/applied/<org-name>/`.
- The target audience for problem documents is any contributor community considering autonomous agents — keep language accessible and avoid presuming solutions.
- Always stage your changes before running `make lint` and fix any failures. Pre-commit only checks staged files — without staging first, it stashes your work and finds nothing to lint.
- When invoking the fullsend CLI from this checkout, **prefer** `go run ./cmd/fullsend …` from the repo root. Do **not** use a `fullsend` binary from mise, `$PATH`, `go install`, or another checkout — those often lag this tree. A stale CLI once rewrote hosted-mint `ALLOWED_ROLES` during enrollment (dropping `e2e`/`fix`) and broke e2e. Details: [Go Code](docs/contributing/go-code.md#running-the-fullsend-cli).
- You **must** read and follow [COMMITS.md](COMMITS.md) when writing or reviewing commit messages and PR titles. Getting the prefix right is not optional — GoReleaser uses PR titles to build release notes. Breaking changes **must** carry the `!` suffix in both commit messages and PR titles; a missing `!` is an important-severity review finding.
- This repository requires a [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/). Human-proposed commits **must** be signed off: use `git commit -s` (or add `Signed-off-by: Your Name <email>` as a trailer). Human-driven agent sessions (e.g., using Claude Code locally) should also sign off — the human directing the session is the one certifying the DCO. **Autonomous agent commits are exempt** and must never supply the DCO with `-s` or with `Signed-off-by`. These agents commit using the GitHub App's bot identity, which the [Probot DCO app](https://github.com/apps/dco) auto-skips.
- Never commit secrets (tokens, API keys, PEM keys, gcloud credentials) or sensitive data (GCP project names, service account identifiers, Model Armor template names, internal hostnames). Use environment variables with no defaults for sensitive values.
- When adding a new doc under `docs/`, check `docs/.vitepress/config.ts` sidebar config. Sections using `getMarkdownFiles()` are auto-discovered. All other sections need a manual `{ text, link }` entry. Also add the new folder's prefix to `search.options.scopes` in the same file so the folder's pages are reachable when search scope pills are active.
- When removing or renaming a CLI command, public API, or user-facing feature, grep all documentation files under `docs/` for references to the old name and update or remove them. Pay special attention to `docs/cli/`, `docs/guides/`, and any getting-started or operations guides that walk through the removed workflow.
- Per-org installation mode is deprecated ([ADR 0044](docs/ADRs/0044-deprecate-per-org-installation-mode.md)) and will be removed in v2.0. Do not add org-mode-specific content to docs or code. When reviewing PRs that reference org mode, flag it as deprecated rather than engaging with org-mode details as active architecture. Per-repo is the sole supported installation model going forward.
