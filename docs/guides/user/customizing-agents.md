# Configuring Agent Behavior

This guide explains how to configure fullsend agents for your organization and repositories through harness configurations and `base:` composition.

## Harness Configuration

Each agent run is configured by a harness YAML file that defines the complete execution environment. These files live in the `.fullsend` config repo (per-org mode) or are registered via `config.yaml` with a `source:` path or `base:` URL.

### Harness YAML Structure

A minimal harness configuration (based on actual fullsend agent harnesses):

```yaml
agent: agents/code.md
model: opus
image: ghcr.io/fullsend-ai/fullsend-code:latest
policy: policies/base.yaml
providers:
  - vertex-ai
  - github
  - package-registries
timeout_minutes: 35

skills:
  - skills/code-implementation

plugins:
  - plugins/gopls-lsp

host_files:
  - src: env/gcp-vertex.env
    dest: /sandbox/workspace/.env.d/gcp-vertex.env
    expand: true
  - src: ${GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS}
    dest: /tmp/.gcp-credentials.json
  - src: ${GCP_OIDC_TOKEN_FILE}
    dest: /sandbox/workspace/.gcp-oidc-token
    optional: true

pre_script: scripts/pre-code.sh
post_script: scripts/post-code.sh

validation_loop:
  script: scripts/validate-output-schema.sh
  schema: schemas/result.schema.json
  max_iterations: 2

env:
  runner:
    PUSH_TOKEN: "${PUSH_TOKEN}"  # auto-minted in CI when --mint-url is provided
    REPO_FULL_NAME: "${REPO_FULL_NAME}"
    REPO_DIR: "${GITHUB_WORKSPACE}/target-repo"
```

> **Where relative script paths resolve.** A **local** harness — the case for
> the example above — resolves `pre_script` / `post_script` against your
> workspace root, so `scripts/pre-code.sh` means *your* `scripts/` directory
> and the harness must ship its own copy. A **URL-sourced** harness resolves
> them against the parent of the harness file's directory in the source repo;
> for the stock agents that is [`fullsend-ai/agents`](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/agents),
> which owns `scripts/pre-code.sh` and `scripts/post-code.sh`.
>
> The fullsend scaffold no longer ships `scripts/pre-code.sh` or
> `scripts/pre-fix.sh`, so copying a stock agents harness into a local file
> without also copying its scripts will fail validation. Reference the
> agents-repo harness by URL instead, or supply your own scripts.
>
> A `pre_script` can also stop the run before the sandbox starts — see the
> [pre-script output protocol](../../normative/prescript-output/v1/README.md).

**Optional fields** (all have secure defaults and can be omitted):

```yaml
providers:                       # Inference providers (names, local paths, or URLs)
  - vertex                       # Local name: references providers/vertex.yaml
  - providers/custom.yaml        # Local path: resolved relative to harness
  - "https://github.com/org/repo/tree/main/providers/claude.yaml#sha256=abc..."  # Remote URL

openshell:                       # Openshell provider profiles (local paths or URLs)
  profiles:
    - profiles/claude-code.yaml    # Local path: resolved relative to harness
    - "https://github.com/org/profiles/tree/main/claude-code.yaml#sha256=def..."

validation_loop:                     # script is required; these sub-fields are optional
  script: scripts/validate-output-schema.sh
  schema: schemas/result.schema.json  # JSON Schema file for output validation (optional)
  feedback_mode: stderr          # "stderr", "stdout", or "exit_code" (optional)

allowed_remote_resources:        # URL prefixes allowed for remote skills/agents/plugins/policies
  - https://github.com/org/       # Omit field: first-party defaults apply automatically
                                   # Non-empty list: your entries + first-party defaults appended
                                   # Set to [] to deny all remote fetches (deny-all)
allow_runtime_fetch: true         # Opt-in to runtime skill fetching (default: false)
max_runtime_fetches: 10           # Max runtime fetch requests per run (1–1000, default: 10)

security:                        # Security is enabled by default with fail_mode: closed
  enabled: true                  # All scanners enabled by default
  fail_mode: closed              # "closed" (reject on failure) or "open" (warn only)
  host_scanners:
    unicode_normalizer: true
    context_injection: true
    ssrf_validator: true
    secret_redactor: true
    llm_guard:
      enabled: true
      threshold: 0.92
      match_type: sentence
  sandbox_hooks:
    tirith:
      enabled: true
      fail_on: high              # "critical", "high", or "medium"
    ssrf_pretool: true
    secret_redact_posttool: true

  escalation:
    on_critical: halt            # "halt" or "review"
    review_label: requires-manual-review
  trace:
    enabled: true
```

### Remote Providers and Profiles

Providers and openshell profiles can be referenced from remote URLs, enabling fully portable harnesses that bundle everything an agent needs.

**`providers`** accepts local provider names, local file paths, and HTTPS URLs with integrity hashes:

```yaml
providers:
  - vertex                       # Local name: loaded from providers/vertex.yaml
  - providers/custom.yaml        # Local path: resolved relative to harness
  - "https://github.com/org/repo/tree/main/providers/claude.yaml#sha256=abc..."  # Remote
```

**`openshell.profiles`** accepts local paths and HTTPS URLs:

```yaml
openshell:
  profiles:
    - profiles/claude-code.yaml    # Local path (resolved relative to harness)
    - "https://github.com/org/profiles/tree/main/claude-code.yaml#sha256=abc..."
```

When using `base:` composition, the base harness can declare its own providers and profiles. Child harnesses inherit and can extend them:

- **Profiles:** base + child lists are concatenated; deduplicated by profile `id` (child wins)
- **Providers:** base + child lists are concatenated; local names shadow URL-resolved names of the same `name`

Remote URLs must include a `#sha256=...` integrity hash and match an `allowed_remote_resources` prefix in the same config. The integrity hash is checked on every resolution to ensure the content hasn't been tampered with since it was pinned.

## Configuration with `base:` Composition

Fullsend uses `base:` harness composition ([ADR 0045](../../ADRs/0045-forge-portable-harness-schema.md)) as the primary mechanism for customizing agents. Register agents in `config.yaml` with a `base:` URL pointing to the upstream harness, and override only the fields that differ.

See [Bring Your Own Agent](bring-your-own-agent.md) for the full composition model and config-driven registration.

**Example: Adding a skill to the code agent**

Register a configured code agent in your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: code
    source: harness/my-code.yaml
```

In `harness/my-code.yaml`, use `base:` to inherit from the upstream harness and add your skill:

```yaml
base: "https://github.com/fullsend-ai/agents/tree/main/harness/code.yaml#sha256=..."
skills:
  - skills/my-custom-validation
```

Create your custom skill at `skills/my-custom-validation/SKILL.md`.

`base:` composition merges fields — you only specify what differs from upstream. This replaces the previous file-level replacement approach.

### Configuring Pre-commit Tool Dependencies

Fullsend auto-detects and installs tools required by a target repo's pre-commit hooks. The resolver reads `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, matches hooks against a tools registry, and installs missing dependencies before the authoritative pre-commit check runs.

Only hooks that pre-commit **cannot self-serve** need registry entries:
- `language: system` — the tool must already be on `PATH`
- `language: golang` — binary download is faster than Go compilation

Hooks using `language: python`, `language: node`, or `language: docker_image` are handled natively by pre-commit and need no registry entry.

#### Prerequisites

- A `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in the target repo with hooks that use `language: system` or `language: golang`.
- Access to commit to the target repo's base branch (per-repo registries only take effect after merge).

#### Two-layer resolution

```
upstream defaults (fullsend-ai/agents)
  → per-repo additive:  .pre-commit-tools.yaml at repo root
```

| Layer | Location | Behavior |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Upstream | Provided at runtime by the agents repo | Base registry shipped with fullsend |
| Per-repo additive | `.pre-commit-tools.yaml` at target repo root | **Merges** with upstream registry |

**Per-repo additive merge** is designed for repos that need to extend the registry with one or two entries. New entries are appended, entries matching an existing `(repo, hook_id)` key override it, and entries with `exclude: true` suppress the matching upstream entry.

#### Adding a custom binary tool

1. Create a `.pre-commit-tools.yaml` file at your repo root.
2. Add an entry with the `hook_id`, `repo`, and `install` fields:

    ```yaml
    tools:
      - hook_id: my-linter
        repo: https://github.com/example/my-linter
        install:
          type: binary
          name: my-linter
          version: "1.2.3"
          url_template: "https://github.com/example/my-linter/releases/download/v{version}/my-linter-{triple}.tar.gz"
          checksums:
            x86_64: "abc123..."
            aarch64: "def456..."
          binary_name: my-linter
    ```

3. Commit and merge to the base branch. The entry is merged with the upstream registry — all upstream tools remain available.

#### Suppressing an upstream entry

1. Add an entry to `.pre-commit-tools.yaml` with the matching `hook_id` and `repo`, plus `exclude: true`:

    ```yaml
    tools:
      - hook_id: gitleaks
        repo: https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks
        exclude: true
    ```

2. Commit and merge to the base branch. The upstream tool will no longer be installed for this repo.

#### Security

Per-repo registries are read from the **base branch**, not from the PR's working tree. This means changes to `.pre-commit-tools.yaml` in a PR do not take effect until the PR is merged. This is intentional — the tool installation pipeline runs outside the sandbox with elevated permissions, and PR content is untrusted.

## Agent Roles

Each agent role has its own identity, permissions, and purpose:

| Role | GitHub App | Purpose |
|------|------------|---------|
| `fullsend` | `{org}-fullsend[bot]` | Dispatch/control |
| `triage` | `{org}-triage[bot]` | Issue triage |
| `coder` | `{org}-coder[bot]` | Code generation |
| `review` | `{org}-review[bot]` | PR review |
| `fix` | (reuses coder app) | Fix failures |
| `retro` | `{org}-retro[bot]` | Retrospectives |
| `prioritize` | `{org}-prioritize[bot]` | Backlog priority |

**Naming conventions:**
- App naming: `{org}-{role}`
- Bot naming: `{org}-{role}[bot]`
- PEM storage: GCP Secret Manager or filesystem (standalone)
- Secret name: `fullsend-{role}-app-pem`

> **Note:** The "fix" role reuses the "coder" app and PEM — no separate GitHub App or secret is created for it.

## Configuration Examples

### Extending the sandbox image

When `host_files` injection is not enough and you need additional packages or
toolchains in the sandbox, build an image that extends the published base and
point your harness `image:` field at it:

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/fullsend-ai/fullsend-sandbox:latest
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends rustc \
  && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

Use `ghcr.io/fullsend-ai/fullsend-code:latest` as the parent instead when you
also need the Go toolchain. Then set `image:` in a thin `base`-composed
harness (see [Configuring existing agents](bring-your-own-agent.md#configuring-existing-agents)).
Pin the parent tag to a digest before CI use.

### Adding Executables

The sandbox already has `/sandbox/workspace/bin` on its `PATH`. To make a
script available as a command, drop it there:

1. Create your script (e.g. `scripts/my-tool.sh`):

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Hello from $0"
   ```

2. Make it executable with `chmod +x scripts/my-tool.sh`.
3. Map it into the sandbox via `host_files`:

   ```yaml
   host_files:
     - src: scripts/my-tool.sh
       dest: /sandbox/workspace/bin/my-tool.sh
   ```

4. The agent should be able to run `my-tool.sh` directly.

#### Advanced: modifying the PATH for external toolchains

When you need a directory outside `/sandbox/workspace/bin` on the `PATH`
(e.g. an external toolchain), use a `.env.d` file:

1. Create an env file (e.g. `env/extra-path.env`):

   ```bash
   PATH=/opt/my-toolchain/bin:$PATH
   ```

2. Map it into the sandbox:

   ```yaml
   host_files:
     - src: env/extra-path.env
       dest: /sandbox/workspace/.env.d/extra-path.env
   ```

3. At startup the sandbox sources every `*.env` file under
   `/sandbox/workspace/.env.d/`, picking up your PATH addition.

**Note**: `env.sandbox` cannot modify `PATH`, the harness ignores special
variables to protect sandbox operation.

### Adding a Skill

Create `skills/my-skill/SKILL.md` in your `.fullsend` config repo or agents repo:

```markdown
# My Custom Skill

Custom domain knowledge for this organization.

## Examples

...
```

Reference the skill in your harness's `skills:` list. The skill is available to all agents that include it in their harness configuration. See [Bring Your Own Agent](bring-your-own-agent.md) for the config-driven approach.

### Overriding an Agent Definition

Use `base:` composition to configure an existing agent with org-specific
instructions. Register the agent in `config.yaml` and point it at a harness
that uses `base:` to inherit from the upstream harness. See
[Configuring existing agents](bring-your-own-agent.md#configuring-existing-agents).

### Configuring the Harness

Use `base:` composition to customize an agent's harness while inheriting
from the upstream defaults. Create a harness file that references the
upstream harness via `base:` and override only the fields that differ:

```yaml
# harness/my-code.yaml — inherits from upstream, overrides what differs
base: "https://github.com/fullsend-ai/agents/tree/main/harness/code.yaml#sha256=..."
model: claude-opus-4-6           # Changed from: opus
timeout_minutes: 45              # Changed from: 35

skills:
  - skills/my-custom-linting     # Added: org-specific skill configuration

validation_loop:
  script: scripts/org-validate.sh
  schema: schemas/org-result.schema.json
  max_iterations: 5
```

Register the agent in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: code
    source: harness/my-code.yaml
```

See [Bring Your Own Agent](bring-your-own-agent.md) for the full
composition model and config-driven registration.

## Status Notifications

Agent workflows post status comments on issues and PRs when they start and complete. Control this with `status_notifications` in `config.yaml`.

For per-org installs, nest it under `defaults`:

```yaml
defaults:
  status_notifications:
    comment:
      start: enabled      # "enabled" (default) | "disabled"
      completion: enabled  # "enabled" (default) | "on_failure" | "disabled"
```

For per-repo installs, set it at the top level of `.fullsend/config.yaml`:

```yaml
status_notifications:
  comment:
    start: enabled
    completion: enabled
```

When `status_notifications` is omitted entirely, both start and completion comments default to enabled.

### Completion modes

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `enabled` | Always post a completion comment (default) |
| `on_failure` | Post when the agent fails, is cancelled, or is skipped by a pre-script; the start comment is automatically suppressed to avoid notification noise |
| `disabled` | Never post a completion comment; silently remove the start comment |

`on_failure` is useful when you want to reduce notification noise — successful runs leave no trace, but failures still surface. When `completion` is set to `on_failure`, the start comment is automatically suppressed regardless of the `start` setting, because posting and then deleting a start comment would still trigger a GitHub notification pointing to a deleted comment.

In `enabled` mode (the default), a hard crash or cancellation that happens before the agent could post anything at all is also surfaced after the fact: a post-job cleanup step synthesizes an "Interrupted" comment so the run doesn't silently vanish.

### Reactions

As an alternative (or supplement) to comments, agents can signal status with emoji reactions on the issue/PR itself. Reactions don't generate a GitHub notification, so they're a lower-noise way to show that an agent is working on something and how it turned out.

```yaml
defaults:
  status_notifications:
    reaction:
      start: enabled       # "enabled" | "disabled" (default)
      completion: enabled  # "enabled" | "on_failure" | "disabled" (default)
```

Unlike comments, reactions default to `disabled` — they're an opt-in addition, not a default-on behavior. When `start` is enabled, a 👀 reaction is added when the agent begins.

At completion, the start reaction (if any) is removed, and — depending on `completion` — replaced with an outcome reaction:

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `enabled` | Always add a completion reaction: 👍 on success, 👎 on failure/cancelled/skipped |
| `on_failure` | Add a 👎 reaction only on failure/cancelled/skipped; leave no reaction on success |
| `disabled` | Never add a completion reaction (default) |

Because reactions carry no notification cost, `on_failure` here simply means "leave no reaction on success," with no start-suppression workaround needed.

Reactions are currently GitHub-only.

## Disabling Agents

To disable an agent (including built-in scaffold agents) without removing
its role, add an entry with `enabled: false` in your config:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: retro
    enabled: false
```

This prevents the agent from dispatching and from resolving via
`fullsend run`. The role can stay in `defaults.roles` — only the agent
is suppressed. Omitting `enabled` (or setting it to `true`) keeps the
agent active (backward compatible).

When multiple entries share a name, the last writer wins. This allows a
disable-then-enable pattern to replace a default agent with a custom one:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: retro
    enabled: false
  - name: retro
    source: harness/custom-retro.yaml
    enabled: true
```

**Important:** The `name` must match the **agent/harness name**, not the
role name. The built-in agent names are: `code`, `triage`, `review`,
`fix`, `retro`, `prioritize`. Note that the role `coder` maps to the
agent named `code` — writing `name: coder` passes validation but
disables nothing because no agent has that harness name.
